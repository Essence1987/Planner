# Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## Description

This Work Day Scheduler was created using Third-Party APIs. It shows the current day at the top of the calander. A user can schedule their work day and save each time slot. When the page refreshes, as long as the user hit save, the entered information will remain. Past times are in Gray. The current time is in Red. Future times are in Green.

## Visuals

The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:
